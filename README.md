# Iceberg

Not the best code ever written. Very WIP but wanted to share with some people. I guess contact me if you stumble upon- and want to use this.

Loosely based on my previous curve editor https://github.com/trevorvanhoof/sqrmelon/ and on rocket https://github.com/rocket/rocket though I have admittedly never used it or looked at the code, just my renoise experience & the readme  :')

Stylesheet from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Alexhuszagh/BreezeStyleSheets/master/dark.qss
